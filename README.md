# Getting Started with the project

## Login Page as default

--> Without creating account you cannot `login` .
--> Here you can create your account using the createAccount button and there you are
--> supposed to enter a `Secret word` which will act as a `credentials` in case of `Forgot --> password.` it can be anything ,your mother's name,relatice name anyone

## Product Page

--> In product page you will get by default `electronics` data , but after clicking on any --> of category , you will se only that specific filtered data

## Products-Details Page

--> In product details page you will be visiting data as per the item clicked `product/12 || product/9 ` or anything like that will be visible

## User Page

--> In product page you will get by default `all gender` data , but after clicking on any --> of gender , you will se only that gender specific filtered data

# In whole project the concern was to store every product data or userData at once so that we don't have hit multiple api on the basis of `onClick`

# Storing data at once will give a `unFlickring` exprience and it make the `performance smooth`
